          <h2>HHH Thursday Dec 15th @4pm üéÑ</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome! Happy Festivities! We're having a Holiday party for our
            corner of the office. The plan is to include our remote co-workers
            as well. To do so we'll have a small game on Slack before lunch. The
            game is called "Do You Hear What I Hear?--Nope, because there isn't
            a Teams Meeting." Just kidding...
          </p>
          <p>
            The Slack Game is very simple and shouldn't take more than 15mins or
            so. It's really just a poll that everyone can vote on. We'll have 5
            pre-determined contestants that will provide the poll options.
            Everyone else can vote!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gift Exchange will take place after work hours at HiWire at 5pm.
            If you would like to join that portion of the party feel free to
            bring a gift. You can also hang out if you aren't feeling gifty. üòÅ{' '}
